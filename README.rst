Package up a bunch of mostly crummy python scripts for messing with Jim Clarke format grades file.

These are used at the department of computer science at the university of toronto for wrangling grades for big undergrad classes.
They should be extinct, but they are useful.
(If you know of better tools please tell me and save me from any further agony.)
